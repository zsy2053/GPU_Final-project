Artificial neural network (ANN) is an information processing method that was inspired by the way
biological nervous system function, (the central nervous systems of animals, in particular the
brain) and are used to estimate or approximate functions that can depend on a large number of
imputs and are generally unknown. Artificial neural networks are generally presented as systems
of interconnected "neurons" which exchange messages between each other. The connections
have numeric weights that can be tuned based on experience, making neural nets adaptive to
inputs and capable of learning.
For example, a neural network for handwriting recognition is defined by a set of input neurons
which may be activated by the pixels of an input image. After being weighted and transformed by
a function (determined by the network's designer), the activations of these neurons are then
passed on to other neurons. This process is repeated until finally, an output neuron is activated.
This determines which character was read.
Like other machine learning methods – systems that learn from data – neural networks have
been used to solve a wide variety of tasks that are hard to solve using ordinary rule-based
programming, including computer vision and speech recognition.
